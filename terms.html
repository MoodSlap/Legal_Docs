    <h1>Terms of Use (EULA)</h1>
    <p class="update-date">Last updated: February 25, 2026</p>

    <p>Please read these Terms of Use ("Terms", "Terms of Use") carefully before using the MoodSlap mobile application
        (the "Service") operated by us.</p>

    <h2>1. Acknowledgment</h2>
    <p>These Terms govern your use of the Service. By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these
        Terms and the <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/" target="_blank">Apple
            Licensed Application End User License Agreement (EULA)</a>. If you disagree with any part of the terms, you
        may not use the Service.</p>

    <h2>2. Age Restriction</h2>
    <p>You must be at least 13 years old to use the Service. By agreeing to these Terms, you represent and warrant that
        you are at least 13 years of age. Use of the Service by anyone under 13 is strictly prohibited.</p>

    <h2>3. Subscription Terms</h2>
    <p>MoodSlap offers auto-renewing subscriptions ("Pro Access") that grant access to premium characters, features,
        and
        content.</p>

    <h3>3.1. Payment & Renewal</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Payment:</strong> Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase.</li>
        <li><strong>Auto-Renewal:</strong> Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at
            least
            24-hours before the end of the current period.</li>
        <li><strong>Account Charge:</strong> Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end
            of the current period at the cost of the chosen package.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3.2. Cancellation</h3>
    <p>You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your App Store Account Settings after purchase. Any
        unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription, where
        applicable.</p>

    <h3>3.3. Free Trials &amp; Gifts</h3>
    <p>MoodSlap may offer limited-time free access to premium characters through:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Free Trials:</strong> A one-time trial period (typically 48 hours) per character, allowing you
            to experience premium content before subscribing. Each character may only be trialed once.</li>
        <li><strong>Gifts:</strong> Other users may gift you temporary access (typically 24 hours) to a premium
            character. Gift durations are fixed and non-extendable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Trial and gift periods expire automatically. After expiration, full access requires an active subscription.</p>

    <h3>3.4. Access Upon Cancellation</h3>
    <p>If your subscription expires or is cancelled:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access to premium characters will revert to limited (freemium) mode.</li>
        <li>Previously unlocked premium characters will return to the store and will no longer be available
            in your active character carousel.</li>
        <li>Your progress, task history, and preferences are retained and will be restored if you resubscribe.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3.5. Device Integrity</h3>
    <p>To ensure fair usage of time-limited features (such as trials and gifts), the App monitors device system
        uptime to verify the accuracy of on-device timers. This check is performed entirely on your device; no data
        is transmitted to external servers. If a time discrepancy is detected, timer calculations may be adjusted
        to reflect actual elapsed time.</p>

    <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The Service and its original content (including but not limited to character designs, artwork, "Mood" and "Slap"
        mechanics, text, and software code) are and will remain the exclusive property of MoodSlap and its licensors.
        You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Service for personal,
        non-commercial entertainment.</p>

    <h2>5. Weather Data Attribution</h2>
    <p>Weather forecasts and related atmospheric data presented in the Service are provided by Apple Weather.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>By using the weather features, you acknowledge that the data source is Apple Weather.</li>
        <li>Use of weather data is subject to the <a href="https://weatherkit.apple.com/legal-attribution.html"
                target="_blank">Apple WeatherKit Legal Attribution</a> requirements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Disclaimer of Warranty</h2>
    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> The Service is provided for <strong>ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY</strong>.
    </div>
    <p>The "characters" within the app (including the "Psychologist", "Fitness Coach", and others) are fictional AI
        simulations. They are <strong>NOT</strong> licensed professionals.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The App does not provide medical, mental health, legal, or financial advice.</li>
        <li>Do not rely on the App for critical life decisions or emergency situations.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>7. Content Warning & Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>MoodSlap includes AI characters with varying motivational styles. All content throughout the app-including
        <strong>character interactions, weather-based phrases, and push notifications</strong>-can contain both
        <strong>gentle encouragement</strong> and <strong>direct, blunt, or provocative language</strong> intended as
        humorous "tough love" motivation.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>For main interactions, you control the tone by pressing one of two buttons: "Mood" for gentle motivation, or
            "Slap" for tough love. Each interaction lasts approximately 2 seconds and is initiated by you.</li>
        <li>Weather phrases and notifications may also use the provocative tone based on your selected character.</li>
        <li>This content is designed for entertainment and motivation, not to harm or offend.</li>
        <li><strong>By using the Service, you acknowledge that you may be exposed to content that is provocative, blunt,
                insulting, or objectionable. You agree to waive, and hereby do waive, any legal or equitable rights or
                remedies you have or may have against MoodSlap and its developers with respect to such content.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>The opinions expressed by the AI characters are fictional and do not reflect the views or values of the
            developers.</li>
        <li>If you find certain content distressing, please use the gentler "Mood" option, switch to a softer character,
            or discontinue use.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>In no event shall MoodSlap, nor its directors, employees, partners, or agents, be liable for any indirect,
        incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of data, use,
        goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from your access to or use of or inability to access or use the
        Service.</p>

    <h2>9. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States, without regard to
        its conflict of law provisions.</p>
