    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="update-date">Last updated: January 8, 2026</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how MoodSlap ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information
        when you use our mobile application (the "Service").</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Summary:</strong> MoodSlap is designed with privacy in mind. We do not sell your personal data. We use
        your microphone only locally to detect screams for gameplay purposes; audio is never recorded to persistent
        storage or uploaded to our servers.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1.1. Personal Data</h3>
    <p>We do not collect or store personally identifiable information (PII) such as your real name, address, or phone
        number on our servers. The name you enter into the App ("User Name") is stored locally on your device and
        synchronized via your personal Apple iCloud account. We do not have access to this data.</p>

    <h3>1.2. Microphone Usage Data</h3>
    <p>MoodSlap requires access to your device's microphone for specific gameplay features (e.g., the "Scream
        Challenge").</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Processing Only:</strong> Microphone input is processed in real-time on your device to measure
            decibel levels.</li>
        <li><strong>No Recording:</strong> We do not record, save, or upload your voice or audio data to any server.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Temporary State:</strong> Audio data is discarded immediately after the gameplay mechanic is
            resolved.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.3. Camera & Photo Library Usage</h3>
    <p>MoodSlap may request access to your device's camera or photo library for specific challenges (e.g., the "Take a
        Photo" daily challenge).</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Processing Only:</strong> Image data is analyzed locally on your device to verify challenge
            completion.</li>
        <li><strong>No Uploads:</strong> We do not upload your photos or camera feed to any server.</li>
        <li><strong>No Storage:</strong> We do not save your photos to the App's persistent storage or your device's
            photo gallery unless you explicitly choose to save them yourself. Data is discarded immediately after the
            gameplay mechanic is resolved.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.4. Usage Data & Analytics</h3>
    <p>We use third-party analytics services (such as Firebase Analytics) to understand how the App is used and to
        improve our Service. This data is anonymized and may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device type and operating system version.</li>
        <li>Feature usage statistics (e.g., how often a character is selected).</li>
        <li>Crash reports and performance data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide and maintain the Service.</li>
        <li>To synchronize your progress across devices using Apple iCloud.</li>
        <li>To monitor usage patterns and detect technical issues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
    <p>All financial transactions are handled directly by Apple via the App Store. We do not process, store, or have
        access to your credit card or payment information.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App may use third-party services that collect information used to identify you (by device ID, not personal
        name). Link to privacy policies of third-party service providers used by the app:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Analytics for Firebase</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/" target="_blank">Apple Services</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Disclaimer regarding AI Characters</h2>
    <p>The characters in MoodSlap (including but not limited to the "Psychologist" and "Fitness Coach") are fictional AI
        personas designed for entertainment purposes only. They do not provide professional medical, psychological,
        legal, or financial advice. Interactions should not be considered a substitute for professional consultation.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable
        information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child
        has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data
        from anyone under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that
        information from our servers.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy
        Policy on this page.</p>
