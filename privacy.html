    <h3>1.3. Location Information</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Processing Only:</strong> Your coordinates are processed locally on your device to fetch
            weather data.</li>
        <li><strong>No Tracking:</strong> We do not track your location history, store your coordinates on our servers,
            or share your location with third parties for advertising purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>Weather Service:</strong> Location data is sent ephemerally to Apple WeatherKit to retrieve current
            weather conditions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.4. Calendar Data</h3>
    <p>MoodSlap may request access to your device's calendar to import events as tasks.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Processing Only:</strong> Calendar events are read locally on your device and stored via your
            personal Apple iCloud account.</li>
        <li><strong>No Server Storage:</strong> We do not store your calendar data on our servers or share it with third
            parties.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional Feature:</strong> Calendar access is entirely optional and only activated when you choose
            to import events.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide and maintain the Service.</li>
        <li>To synchronize your progress across devices using Apple iCloud.</li>
        <li>To monitor usage patterns and detect technical issues.</li>
        <li>To provide localized weather phrase generation via Apple WeatherKit.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
    <p>All financial transactions are handled directly by Apple via the App Store. We do not process, store, or have
        access to your credit card or payment information.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App may use third-party services that collect information used to identify you (by device ID, not personal
        name). Link to privacy policies of third-party service providers used by the app:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Analytics for Firebase</a></li>
