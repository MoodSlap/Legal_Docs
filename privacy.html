    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="update-date">Last updated: February 6, 2026</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how MoodSlap ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information
        when you use our mobile application (the "Service").</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Summary:</strong> MoodSlap is designed with privacy in mind. We do not sell your personal data.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1.1. Personal Data</h3>
    <p>We do not collect or store personally identifiable information (PII) such as your real name, address, or phone
        number on our servers. The name you enter into the App ("User Name") is stored locally on your device and
        synchronized via your personal Apple iCloud account. We do not have access to this data.</p>



    <h3>1.2. Usage Data & Analytics</h3>
    <p>We use third-party analytics services (such as Firebase Analytics) to understand how the App is used and to
        improve our Service. This data is anonymized and may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device type and operating system version.</li>
        <li>Feature usage statistics (e.g., how often a character is selected).</li>
        <li>Crash reports and performance data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.3. Location Information</h3>
    <p>MoodSlap requests access to your device's location ("Approximate" or "Precise") solely to provide local
        weather-based content.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Processing Only:</strong> Your coordinates are processed locally on your device to fetch
            weather data.</li>
        <li><strong>No Tracking:</strong> We do not track your location history, store your coordinates on our servers,
            or share your location with third parties for advertising purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>Weather Service:</strong> Location data is sent ephemerally to Apple WeatherKit to retrieve current
            weather conditions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.4. Calendar Data</h3>
    <p>MoodSlap may request access to your device's calendar to import events as tasks.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Processing Only:</strong> Calendar events are read locally on your device and stored via your
            personal Apple iCloud account.</li>
        <li><strong>No Server Storage:</strong> We do not store your calendar data on our servers or share it with third
            parties.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional Feature:</strong> Calendar access is entirely optional and only activated when you choose
            to import events.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.5. External Calendar Subscriptions (Webcal)</h3>
    <p>MoodSlap allows you to subscribe to external calendar feeds (webcal/ICS URLs) to import events.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User-Provided URLs:</strong> You provide the calendar subscription URL (e.g., from Google
            Calendar,
            Outlook, or other services). We do not access your accounts directly.</li>
        <li><strong>Direct Fetch:</strong> Your device fetches calendar data directly from the URL you provide.
            This data is not routed through our servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Imported events are stored locally on your device and synchronized via
            your personal Apple iCloud account.</li>
        <li><strong>No Credential Storage:</strong> We do not store your calendar service credentials or passwords.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.6. Background Data Refresh</h3>
    <p>MoodSlap uses Background App Refresh to periodically update data for its Home Screen widget.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> The app refreshes external calendar subscriptions (webcal/ICS)
            in the background to keep widget content up to date.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Processing Only:</strong> All data processing occurs locally on your device.
            No data is sent to our servers during background refresh.</li>
        <li><strong>No Additional Data Collection:</strong> Background refresh does not collect any
            new or additional data beyond what is described in sections 1.4 and 1.5.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide and maintain the Service.</li>
        <li>To synchronize your progress across devices using Apple iCloud.</li>
        <li>To monitor usage patterns and detect technical issues.</li>
        <li>To provide localized weather phrase generation via Apple WeatherKit.</li>
        <li>To refresh calendar subscriptions in the background for Home Screen widget updates.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
    <p>All financial transactions are handled directly by Apple via the App Store. We do not process, store, or have
        access to your credit card or payment information.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>

        we may request your permission to track your activity across other companies' apps and websites
        (App Tracking Transparency).</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>If you allow tracking:</strong> Your device's advertising identifier (IDFA) may be shared with
            ad networks to show you personalized advertisements.</li>

            No tracking data will be collected.</li>
        <li><strong>Changing your preference:</strong> You can change your tracking preference at any time in
            Settings → Privacy & Security → Tracking.</li>
