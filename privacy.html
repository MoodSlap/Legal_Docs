    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="update-date">Last updated: February 25, 2026</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how MoodSlap ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and discloses your information
        when you use our mobile application (the "Service").</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Summary:</strong> MoodSlap is designed with privacy in mind. We do not sell your personal data.
    </div>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1.1. Personal Data</h3>
    <p>We do not collect or store personally identifiable information (PII) such as your real name, address, or phone
        number on our servers. The name you enter into the App ("User Name") is stored locally on your device and
        synchronized via your personal Apple iCloud account. We do not have access to this data.</p>



    <h3>1.2. Usage Data & Analytics</h3>
    <p>We use third-party analytics services (such as Firebase Analytics) to understand how the App is used and to
        improve our Service. This data is anonymized and may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device type and operating system version.</li>
        <li>Feature usage statistics (e.g., how often a character is selected).</li>
        <li>Crash reports and performance data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.3. Location Information</h3>
    <p>MoodSlap requests access to your device's location ("Approximate" or "Precise") solely to provide local
        weather-based content.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Processing Only:</strong> Your coordinates are processed locally on your device to fetch
            weather data.</li>
        <li><strong>No Tracking:</strong> We do not track your location history, store your coordinates on our servers,
            or share your location with third parties for advertising purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>Weather Service:</strong> Location data is sent ephemerally to Apple WeatherKit to retrieve current
            weather conditions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.4. Calendar Data</h3>
    <p>MoodSlap may request access to your device's calendar to import events as tasks.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Processing Only:</strong> Calendar events are read locally on your device and stored via your
            personal Apple iCloud account.</li>
        <li><strong>No Server Storage:</strong> We do not store your calendar data on our servers or share it with third
            parties.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional Feature:</strong> Calendar access is entirely optional and only activated when you choose
            to import events.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.5. External Calendar Subscriptions (Webcal)</h3>
    <p>MoodSlap allows you to subscribe to external calendar feeds (webcal/ICS URLs) to import events.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User-Provided URLs:</strong> You provide the calendar subscription URL (e.g., from Google
            Calendar,
            Outlook, or other services). We do not access your accounts directly.</li>
        <li><strong>Direct Fetch:</strong> Your device fetches calendar data directly from the URL you provide.
            This data is not routed through our servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Imported events are stored locally on your device and synchronized via
            your personal Apple iCloud account.</li>
        <li><strong>No Credential Storage:</strong> We do not store your calendar service credentials or passwords.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.6. Background Data Refresh</h3>
    <p>MoodSlap uses Background App Refresh to periodically update data for its Home Screen widget.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> The app refreshes external calendar subscriptions (webcal/ICS)
            in the background to keep widget content up to date.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Processing Only:</strong> All data processing occurs locally on your device.
            No data is sent to our servers during background refresh.</li>
        <li><strong>No Additional Data Collection:</strong> Background refresh does not collect any
            new or additional data beyond what is described in sections 1.4 and 1.5.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.7. Device Integrity Data</h3>
    <p>To ensure the accuracy of time-limited features (such as free trials and gifts), MoodSlap may
        collect and process the following data locally on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>System Uptime:</strong> The App reads your device's system uptime to verify the accuracy
            of on-device timers. This data is used solely for timer calculations and is never transmitted
            to external servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Keychain Storage:</strong> Trial expiration dates are stored in the device Keychain
            to persist across app reinstalls, ensuring each trial can only be used once per character.
            This data is stored locally and is not accessible to us.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.8. User Accounts & Cloud Sync (MoodSlap ID)</h3>
    <p>MoodSlap generates an anonymous, unique identifier ("MoodSlap ID") to enable cloud synchronization and social
        features.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cloud Storage:</strong> This ID, along with associated app data (such as active characters, tasks,
            and preferences), is stored securely on our cloud servers (powered by Google Firebase/Firestore).</li>
        <li><strong>No PII Required:</strong> We do not require your real name, email, or phone number to generate a
            MoodSlap ID. Linking an email address to your account is entirely optional and used solely for account
            recovery or gifting purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.9. Shared Tasks & User-Generated Content</h3>
    <p>If you choose to use the "Family & Friends" features to send tasks or share shopping lists:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Transmitted Data:</strong> The text of the tasks/lists you send, along with your MoodSlap ID and the
            recipient's MoodSlap ID, is transmitted through and temporarily stored on our servers to facilitate
            delivery.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy & Access:</strong> We do not proactively monitor, read, or use your private shared tasks for
            advertising or any other purpose. However, because this content flows through our servers to enable
            delivery, we technically have access to it and reserve the right to review specific data only if strictly
            necessary to resolve technical issues, investigate reports of abuse, or comply with legal obligations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide, maintain, and synchronize the Service across your devices via our cloud infrastructure.</li>
        <li>To facilitate the "Family & Friends" features (Shared Tasks and Lists).</li>
        <li>To monitor usage patterns, detect technical issues, and provide customer support (including remote account
            troubleshooting).</li>
        <li>To prevent fraud, abuse of the referral system, and to enforce our Terms of Service.</li>
        <li>To provide localized weather phrase generation via Apple WeatherKit.</li>
        <li>To refresh calendar subscriptions in the background for Home Screen widget updates.</li>
        <li>To manage time-limited features (trials, gifts) using local and server-side integrity checks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
    <p>All financial transactions are handled directly by Apple via the App Store. We do not process, store, or have
        access to your credit card or payment information.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App may use third-party services that collect information used to identify you (by device ID, not personal
        name). Link to privacy policies of third-party service providers used by the app:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Analytics for Firebase</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/" target="_blank">Apple Services</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://weatherkit.apple.com/legal-attribution.html" target="_blank">Apple WeatherKit</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">Google AdMob</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.1. Advertising and Tracking</h3>
    <p>MoodSlap displays optional rewarded video advertisements powered by Google AdMob. When you choose to watch an ad,
        we may request your permission to track your activity across other companies' apps and websites
        (App Tracking Transparency).</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>If you allow tracking:</strong> Your device's advertising identifier (IDFA) may be shared with
            ad networks to show you personalized advertisements.</li>
        <li><strong>If you deny tracking:</strong> You will still see ads, but they will be non-personalized.
            No tracking data will be collected.</li>
        <li><strong>Changing your preference:</strong> You can change your tracking preference at any time in
            Settings → Privacy & Security → Tracking.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Disclaimer regarding AI Characters</h2>
    <p>The characters in MoodSlap (including but not limited to the "Psychologist" and "Fitness Coach") are fictional AI
        personas designed for entertainment purposes only. They do not provide professional medical, psychological,
        legal, or financial advice. Interactions should not be considered a substitute for professional consultation.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable
        information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child
        has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data
        from anyone under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that
        information from our servers.</p>

    <h2>7. Account Deletion & Data Retention</h2>
    <p>You have the right to delete your MoodSlap ID and all associated data at any time.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>How to Delete:</strong> You can initiate account deletion directly within the App by navigating to
            Settings → Privacy & Data → "Delete Account".</li>
        <li><strong>What Happens:</strong> Upon request, your MoodSlap ID, shared tasks, lists, and any linked
            information (such as an optional email) will be permanently deleted from our active servers within 30 days.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Local Data:</strong> Deleting your cloud account does not automatically delete data stored locally
            on your device (e.g., in Apple iCloud). You must uninstall the app to remove local data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
